## Core Phase 2 Features (Priority Order):

### 1. Semantic Kernel Integration (Weeks 1-3)
- Add IAIOrchestrationService interface in Application layer
- Create Semantic Kernel wrapper that sits above Microsoft.Extensions.AI
- Implement kernel plugins for advanced orchestration
- Add prompt templates and multi-step AI workflows

### 2. Function Calling Architecture (Weeks 4-6)
- Web Search integration (Tavily/Serper API)
- File System tools with security boundaries
- KernelFunction attributes for automatic tool discovery
- FunctionChoiceBehavior.Auto() for intelligent tool selection

### 3. Conversation Persistence (Weeks 7-8)
- PostgreSQL database integration
- Conversation entity and repository pattern
- User-specific conversation storage
- Load/save functionality in frontend

### 4. User Authentication (Weeks 9-10)
- ASP.NET Core Identity integration
- JWT token authentication
- User registration/login endpoints
- Conversation isolation per user

### 5. Advanced Infrastructure (Weeks 11-18)
- Global exception middleware (replacing basic try-catch)
- Structured logging with Serilog and Application Insights
- Distributed caching for performance
- Rate limiting for abuse protection
- Comprehensive testing suite (unit + integration tests)
- Production deployment with Azure configuration

## Key Architecture Updates:
- Semantic Kernel sits in Application layer, wrapping Microsoft.Extensions.AI
- New IAIOrchestrationService interface for advanced AI workflows
- Repository pattern for database operations
- Enhanced Clean Architecture with production-ready patterns

This roadmap transforms the MVP into an enterprise-grade AI platform with function calling, persistent conversations, user management, and production-ready infrastructure while maintaining the Clean Architecture foundation.
